Background
==========
This document describes the process used to generate and distribute
the Yeti root.

The Yeti DNS Project takes the [IANA root zone][1], and performs
minimal changes needed to serve the zone from the [Yeti root
servers][2] instead of the [IANA root servers][3].

In Yeti, this modified root zone is generated by the Yeti Distribution
Masters (DM), which provide it to the Yeti root servers.

While in principle this could be done by a single DM, Yeti uses a set
of three DM. These DM coordinate their work so that the resulting Yeti
root zone is always consistent. (We need to avoid the case where not
all DM share the same set of Yeti root servers, and so they produce
different versions of the Yeti root zone with the same serial.)


Generation
==========
The generation process is:

1. Download the latest IANA root zone
2. Make modifications to change from the IANA to Yeti root servers
3. Sign the new Yeti root zone
4. Publish the new Yeti root zone

IANA Root Zone
--------------
The root zone is currently downloaded using AXFR from
F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET:

```sh
   $ dig -t axfr . @f.root-servers.net.
```

This appears to be the best way to get the updated version of the root
zone as soon as possible.

TODO: The DM should check that the zone they are retrieving from IANA
is properly signed, with something like ldns-verify-zone.

A new version of the Yeti zone is only generated when the IANA zone
changes, which is detected by the change in the serial number value in
the SOA record.

KSK secret
----------
All DM share the same KSK secret material. This generated using the
BIND 9 dnssec-keygen tool, and then sent via encrypted PGP to the
other DM operators.

Modifications
-------------
The root zone is modified as follows:

* The SOA is updated:
    * The MNAME and RNAME are set to Yeti values
* The IANA DNSSEC information is removed:
    * The DNSKEY records
    * The RRSIG and NSEC records
* The IANA root server records are removed:
    * The NS records for [A-M].ROOT-SERVERS.NET
* The Yeti DNSSEC information is added:
    * The DNSKEY records
* The Yeti root server records are added:
    * The NS records
    * The AAAA glue records
* The Yeti root zone is signed

It might be worthwhile to use the serial value in the SOA field,
however for now we duplicate the IANA serial value.

The list of Yeti name Servers is synchronized between the DM as
described below.

Timing
------
Each Yeti DM checks to see if the IANA root zone has changed hourly,
on the following schedule:

| DM   | Time        |
|------|-------------|
| BII  | _hour_ + 00 |
| WIDE | _hour_ + 20 |
| TISF | _hour_ + 40 |

A new version of the Yeti root zone is generated if the IANA root zone
has changed.

Synchronizing Yeti DM Configuration
===================================
Synchronization between the Yeti DM is described in the [Yeti DM
Synchronization document][4].
