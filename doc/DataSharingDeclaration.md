_This is a *draft* data sharing declaration._

##Yeti Data Sharing Declaration

The Yeti Project has standards for data sharing that all Participants
agree to. Each Participant must make a declaration that they will
follow these standards.

"Participant" in this declaration means anyone that wishes to either
submit or access Yeti Data. For example, this includes operators of
Yeti root servers, operators of resolvers using those servers, or Yeti
researchers. Only Participants who have executed this Data Sharing
Declaration may submit or have access to Yeti Data.

"Yeti Data" means data files provided by Participants or generated by
Yeti systems or Participants and residing on Yeti systems with the
intention of sharing. Examples of Yeti Data include, but are not
limited to: (a) raw packet captures, generally in the form of “pcap”
files; (b) name server query log files; (c) archived zone files; and
(d) other types of log files relating to network traffic, attacks, or
application transactions.

1. Types of Yeti Data.
    1. Raw: data submitted by Participants (for example pcap
       captures);
    2. Generated: data generated by Yeti systems and applications 
       (for example Benchmarks, Monitoring);
    3. Derivative: data derived by analysis from one or more Raw data
       sets.

2. Categories of Yeti Data.

    1. Confidential. Unless otherwise specified at the time of
       submission or generation, all Yeti Data shall be deemed
       Confidential and may not be disseminated to any parties,
       whether or not they are Yeti Participants. All such
       Confidential Yeti Data may be used by Yeti Participants,
       provided that they (i) shall hold all Confidential Yeti Data in
       the highest confidence, (ii) shall not disclose, disseminate or
       publicize any Confidential Yeti Data to any person or entity,
       and (iii) shall take all action necessary or appropriate to
       hold all Confidential Yeti Data in the highest confidence.

    2. Exceptions to Confidentiality. Confidential Yeti Data shall not
       include: (A) Yeti Data already in possession of the
       non-disclosing party through lawful means or through
       independent development, (B) Yeti Data which are publicly
       available when received or thereafter becomes publicly
       available through no fault of the non-submitting party, and (C)
       Yeti Data which are required to be disclosed as a result of a
       final order of a court of competent jurisdiction in a
       proceeding in which the submitting party has had a reasonable
       opportunity to contest disclosure.
    
    3. Non-Confidential. If a Participant wishes certain Yeti Data to
       be treated as Non-Confidential, Participant shall clearly
       designate such Yeti Data at the time of submission or
       generation as Non-Confidential Yeti Data. All such
       Non-Confidential Yeti Data may be disseminated to any parties,
       whether or not they are Yeti Participants.

3. Submission of Yeti Data. Each time Participant submits any Yeti
   Data to Yeti, Participant must designate what restrictions, if any,
   are to be placed on the Yeti Data. This includes whether such Yeti
   Data are Confidential or Non-Confidential, attributable or
   anonymous, whether redistributable or not, and so forth, as
   appropriate.  Participant is solely responsible for designation of
   any applicable restrictions. In the absence of any such designated
   restrictions, the Yeti Data submitted shall be deemed to be
   Confidential. Certain Yeti Data collected will have defined
   designations.  Participant is solely responsible for designation of
   any applicable restrictions if none have been otherwise defined.

4. Source-Identifying Yeti Data. Participant may choose, at its own
   discretion, to “anonymize” source-identifying elements (for example
   IP addresses) prior to submitting Yeti Data.
