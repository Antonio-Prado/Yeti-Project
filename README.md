"One World, One Internet, One Namespace" is the essence for the success of today's Internet. 
However, as the top level of the unique identifier system, the DNS root system, which has 
been operational for 25+ years, is a pivot to make the current Internet useful. So it is
considered somewhat ossified for stability reasons. It is hard to test and implement new 
ideas evolving to a more advanced level to counter the challenges like IPv6-only operation,
DNSSEC key rollover, scaling issues, etc. Because changes to the current production system
are not risk-free, and a large-scaled Testbed is necessary, on which fully tests and studies
on the impact can be carried out. It is possible to pre-evaluate such a change in a laboratory
test, however, the coverage is very limited. In order to make the test more practical, it is 
also necessary to involve usersâ€™ environment which is highly diversified, to study the effect
of the change in question.
