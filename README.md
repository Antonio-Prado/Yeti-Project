# Welcome to the Yeti Project
------

"One World, One Internet, One Namespace" is the essence for the success of today's Internet. The top level of the unique identifier system, the DNS root system, has been operational for 25+ years. It is a pivot to make the current Internet useful. So it is considered somewhat ossified for stability reasons. It is hard to test and implement new ideas evolving to a more advanced level to counter challenges like IPv6-only operation, DNSSEC key/algorithm rollover, scaling issues, etc. Because changes to the current production system are not risk-free, and a large-scale testbed is necessary, on which extensive tests and studies of the impact can be carried out. It is possible to pre-evaluate such changes in a laboratory test, however, the coverage is limited. In order to make the test more practical, it is also necessary to involve users’ environment which is highly diversified, to study the effect of the changes in question. 
 
As a result the proposal of Yeti Project is formed which is aiming to build such a live environment. The basic idea is to build a parallel experimental live DNS root system to provide useful technical output with the existing production systems. Possible research agenda will be explored on this testbed covering several aspects but not limited to:

* IPv6-only operation
* DNSSEC key rollover
* Renumbering issues
* Scalability issues
* Multiple zone file signers

In addition measurement study will be done to create useful analysis as output of Yeti Project.

Participants will be invited into Yeti Project which is hopefully helpful for their own interests. We would like to invite some interested parties in this community, like the research labs of universities and institutes. We also hope Yeti Project can gain the support from vendors, for example, the DNS software implementers, Developers of CPE devices & IoT devices, middlebox developers who can test their product and connect their own testbed into Yeti testbed. It is expected that the activity of Yeti Project could have good input to the DNS related industry, which will finally make them ready for advanced DNS and Root services.  

*NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT NEVER INTENT TO REPLACE CURRENT OPERATIONAL ROOT DNS SYSTEM.　REGULAR DNS SERVICES MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE TESTBED.*
